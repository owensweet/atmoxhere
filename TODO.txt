- background pixel animation stuff or ascii art
- fuck round wiht the sigilism shit
- language toggle
- back button is trash


# ISSUES

- text offset for the logo
- add buy button and stripe connection, on mee6 is login
- try the 3d shit tmrw with the chatgpt instance
- vignette streches with body, should just cover the viewport

- Magnifying glass effect for slug page?

- Floating divs for more spaceyness?

- Use gimpedit pieces for card borders instead? or maybe just figma a sci fi shape

- Make sure stripe post and get requests are secure (maybe csrf token?)
