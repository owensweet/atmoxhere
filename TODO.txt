# ISSUES

- BACKBUTTON AND TITLE IS SPACED WEIRD
- CRT EFFECT DOESNT EXTEND UP THE TOP AND BOTTOM
- text offset for the logo
- Image fetching weirdness, viewed on termite jeans slug page
- Scroll issue
- add buy button and stripe connection, on mee6 is login
- try the 3d shit tmrw with the chatgpt instance
- vignette streches with body, should just cover the viewport

- Magnifying glass effect for slug page?

- Floating divs for more spaceyness?

- Use gimpedit pieces for card borders instead? or maybe just figma a sci fi shape

- Make sure stripe post and get requests are secure (maybe csrf token?)
